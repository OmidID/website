<p><strong>NOTE: I make lots of assumptions about things I do not fully understand (C stuff). Please help me figure out what we need and what we don't need. :) - jpobst</strong></p>
<p>One of my goals for Mono 2.8 is to have a completely new .msi (the Windows standard) based installer for Windows.</p>
<p>Currently, our Windows installer is not .msi, and is bloated with all kinds of things that don't really make sense to ship on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-changes">Proposed Changes</h2>
<h3 id="use-msvc-instead-of-gcc-to-compile-native-code">Use MSVC instead of gcc to compile native code</h3>
<p>This will require vcproj files for all the native libraries/executables. This will also require redistributing the C runtimes from MS. We can either require admin privileges and install them into the machine side-by-side cache, or install them privately to mono.</p>

<h3 id="use-eglib-instead-of-glib">Use eglib instead of glib</h3>
<p>This is the first step to not requiring cygwin. Also, the code produced by VC++ is likely better tuned for running on Windows.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-ship-the-1.0-profile">Do not ship the 1.0 profile</h3>
<p>This is simply a Mono 2.8 change. The 1.0/1.1 profile is no longer supported/shipped after Mono 2.6.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-ship-gtk">Do not ship Gtk#</h3>
<p>We should modify our &quot;Gtk# installer for .Net&quot; to also install to the Mono GAC instead of shipping a second copy with Mono.</p>
<p>Note: There needs to be some work done with regards to ensuring Gtk# picks up our version of Gtk+ instead of the one installed with Pidgin, Inkscape, Miro, etc. Currently, the first one in PATH is used.</p>

<h3 id="what-gnu-ish-stuff-do-we-still-need-to-include">What GNU-ish(?) stuff do we still need to include?</h3>
<p>I don't know a lot about this, but I guess we need either eglib or custom versions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>pkg-config</li>
<li>gettext?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With these changes, I think we can get a learner, meaner installer that is .msi-based. My current estimation is we can get the installer under 30 MB. Currently, it is 75-80 MB.</p>
