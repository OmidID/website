Olive is a set of add-on libraries for the Mono core that bring some of
the new .NET APIs to Mono.

Olive is unsupported, should be considered as experimental software, and
since it implements a shifting API there are no guarantees of any kind
about the stability of the API.

Currently Olive contains:

-   [Workflow]({{site.url}}/Workflow "wikilink") 3.5 APIs
-   [PresentationFoundation]({{site.url}}/PresentationFoundation "wikilink") and
    [WindowsBase]({{site.url}}/WindowsBase "wikilink") (only [XAML]({{site.url}}/XAML "wikilink")
    support)

If you are interested in contributing see our [contributing
guidelines]({{site.url}}/Contributing "wikilink"). You can also get a fresh copy from
