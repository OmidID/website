The following toolkits are no longer under active development.

(DEAD) Sharp WT
---------------

Homepage:
[<http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop>](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop)

THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED BECAUSE OF LACK OF
INTEREST.

This is a project started by the developers of SharpDevelop.

The project started due to the limitations on Windows.Forms and the need
to port their large application to Linux. They picked the SWT toolkit
which is part of Eclipse and ported it from Java to C\#.

SWT uses native widgets on each one of its target platforms, so the look
and feel matches the underlying operating system.

Pros:

-   Native look and feel on various platforms (Windows, Linux and
    MacOS).
-   Clean design.
-   The Java version has been successfully used by the Eclipse project.

Cons:

-   Little or no documentation.
-   Authoring new widgets is either hard (due to testing on multiple
    platforms), or the look and feel is unique.
-   Still under heavy development.
-   Common denominator subset API problem.

(DEAD) Qt\#
-----------

![QT\#
Sample](http://localhost:4000/files/Mahjongg-0.6-window.png "fig:QT# Sample")
Homepage:
[<http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net/>](http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net/)

THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED BECAUSE OF LACK OF
INTEREST.

This is a binding to the Qt toolkit. This toolkit used to be under
development, but its development has pretty much stopped.

Pros:

-   Native look and feel on each platform.

Cons:

-   Toolkit is licensed under the GPL, and the Qt substrate has further
    licensing limitations. It is not suitable for proprietary or non-GPL
    development.
-   Binding is unmaintained.
-   Currently its layered on top of the C binding to Qt.
