We're working on the Same Thing
===============================

Hi, I'd like to mention that I am working on [a version of that
page](User:ValentinSawadski#{{site.url}}/ThreadsBeginnersGuide "wikilink") as well.
But my Article is not finished yet and so I didn't post it here.
Unfortionatly I don't have much time to work on the article on a regular
basis so if you want to complete that article please feel free to use my
content as well.

Uploaded my Version
-------------------

Hello,

since this article has made little or no progress in quite some time
I've taken myself the freedom of rewriting it completely. The new
version of the article is now online. So if there's someone working
still working on it without me knowing please take a look if there is a
way that we could merge our efforts.
