<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This is the template that should be used for all bugs when they are entered into Bugzilla. Here is an <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=459153">example</a>.</p>
<h3 id="remember">Remember</h3>
<p>Whenever you log a bug, please remember to add a comment with a <a href="Accessibility:_Testing_Howto#http://localhost:4000/Bug_References" title="wikilink">bug reference</a> (e.g., BUG459153) where the bug occurs in your test. You must use the syntax BUG[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] so it can be easily found when regressing bugs.</p>

<h4 id="problem-statement">PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h4>

The instructions should be detailed and clear enough that anyone (developer, community member, new employee) can reproduce the bug. Remember to include any special setup steps.</em><br /><br />====RESULTS:==== <em>What happens what the REPRO steps are followed</em><br /><br />====EXPECTED RESULTS:==== <em>What *should* happen when the REPRO steps are followed</em><br /><br />====COMMENTS:==== <em>Any additional information</em></p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>Here are some definitions to keep in mind when submitting a bug in Bugzilla:</p>
<h4 id="severity">SEVERITY</h4>
<p>Define defect severity value by Bugzilla default severity definition. The severity describes the impact of a bug.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocker: Prevents developers or testers from performing their jobs. Impacts the development process.</li>
<li>Critical: Crash, loss of data, corruption of data, severe memory leak.</li>
<li>Major: Major loss of function, as specified in the product requirements for this release, or existing in the current</li>
<li>Normal: Non-major loss of function.</li>
<li>Minor: Issue that can be viewed as trivial (e.g. cosmetic, UI, easily documented).</li>
<li>Enhancement: Request for software enhancement, or any non-defect task or work item.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="priority">PRIORITY</h4>
<p>Define defect priority value by Bugzilla default priority definition. The priority specifies the level of urgency to be resolved for the defect.</p>
<ul>
<li>P1-Urgent: Defects are urgent issues. Developers should try to fix P1 issues as soon as possible during the current iteration.</li>
<li>P2-High: Defects must be resolved in this release. Developers should try to fix P2 issues during the next iteration.</li>
<li>P3-Medium: Defects would like to be fix, but won't hold shipment for them.</li>
<li>P4-Low: Defects are not as strong as desirable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bugzilla has many fields that provide additional information (e.g., environment details, found in version, etc.). Please provide as much information as possible when logging bugs.</p>
