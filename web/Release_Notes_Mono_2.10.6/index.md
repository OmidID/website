Bug Fixes
=========

-   Handle threads that die without detaching, this bug prevented
    debugging from working on setups like MonoDevelop debugging MonoMac
    apps.

-   System.Data Sql Expression parser has been updated to allow TRIM and
    SUBSTRING to allow more expression types as well as adding support
    for null literals as well as removing the internal reduce/reduce
    conflicts in the grammar (Xamarin \#665).

-   The C\# compiler will now recognize the Lion OSX Terminal as one
    where it should use colors.

-   Fixed various components of the test suite to run under the
    MONO\_MOBILE profile.

-   Support roundtrip of the Local timezone (Xamarin \#326)

-   Use a TaskCompletionSource in non-generic ContinueWhenAny case.
    (Xamarin \#647)

-   If epoll fails, fallback to poll (Novell \#705190)

-   Implement AppDomain.ResourceResolve. (Xamarin \#579)

-   Allow pointers to structures to be passed in pinvoke, MS seems to
    allow this at least in some cases. Fixes Xamarin \#158.

WCF Fixes
---------

-   WCF, add checks for partDesc (Xamarin \#612)

-   UriTemplate should not be mandatory, make it optional.

-   UriTemplate: When there was no path parameter, it ignored the whole
    path part.

-   Differentiate GET query parameter binding from another request
    binding. (Xamarin \#206)

-   ReturnValue in MessageDescription was missing when there was
    MessageContract.

-   When there is void return, the common message formatter should
    ignore it.

-   Transport security can now be set for WCF Basic Auth calls. (Xamarin
    \#380)

-   Implement IXmlLineInfo on XLinq node reader.

SGen Updates
============
