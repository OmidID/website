Mono 3.2 is a portable and open source implementation of the .NET
framework for Unix, Windows, MacOS and other operating systems.

Mono 3.2 is an update to [Mono 3.0](Release Notes Mono 3.0{{site.url}}/ "wikilink")
based on the master branch of github, it is not a minor upgrade to 3.0.
Mono 3.2 was released on July 24th, 2013.

Support for Mono versions 3.0 and 2.10 is been discontinued. No further
development of bug fixing is planned for those branches.

New in Mono 3.2.7
=================

New in 3.2.7

This is a major feature release that accumulates about 5 months of
development

Highlights
----------

5 months of work, 1235 commits by 65 contributors.

Initial support for the hardfp ABI on ARM. This enables mono to be used
on more recent versions of linux and produce better code on those
targets.

The ABCREM optimization received a lot of love, now it works much better
on 64bits systems.

Two new optimizations were added, a Loop Invariant Code Motion pass and
Alias Analysis are now available. Performance in some functions can
improve as much as 20%.

Hardware fences and atomic operations got a large revamp together with
support for dynamic feature detection.

64bits CAS instructions are now supported on 32bits systems. This
resulted in a significant performance boost on PLINQ workloads with
multiple core.

Our LLVM integration got some love. It can now generate fast TLS access,
a more recent LLVM version is been used and the list of optimizations we
let it perform has been updated.

Our GC received some micro-optimization love by some small optimization
in internal data structures and the use of intrinsics to speed up some
core loops.

System.Core now has an interpreter for LINQ expressions and dynamic
statements that can be used by FullAOT runtimes.

Better support for custom task schedulers.

Significantly improved reachability and flow analysis in C\# compiler.

-   Improper stack size detection on Mavericks lead F\# and C\#
    compilers to crash.
-   Includes the latest F\# release, 3.0.31.

New in Mono 3.2.4
=================

This is a bug fixing only release.

Fix some packaging issues.

Fix System.IO.Compression.CompressionLevel enum.

Include namespace-level summary and remarks elements [\#14672]

Multiple fixes to the PCL Facade assemblies.

New in Mono 3.2.3
=================

Highlights
----------

This release features over 2 months of fixes a few nice features.

We're now back to do simultaneous releases to Windows, Linux and Mac.

The C\# compiler has a lot of fixes for async related issues.

New static and dynamic hardware capabilities probing, mono can now
exploit hardware caps in many more cases than before.

Blended v5/v7 mode for arm. Some ARM targets require binaries that
support all the way from very old CPUs to the most modern ones.
Previously we would fail to work on SMP machines when built for UP
targets.

Added skeletons for both System.DirectoryServices and
System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.

New server focused flag. Run mono with --server to tell the runtime to
target performance. With this release, this means an aggressive
threadpool scheduler that creates additional threads faster.

We put a lot of effort on windows for this release. Builds are now based
on a recent mingw toolchain. We fixes a good number of build issues and
bugs in the windows backed.

We have finally switched to use vectored exception handling on windows,
which makes it possible, for those of us that like Inception, to debug
mono's debugger.

And, finally, PCL has arrived. This means a few fixes in the runtime,
class libraries and build tools. And, on Mac, we now ship PCL reference
assemblies.

New in Mono 3.2.1
=================

Mono 3.2.1 is a hot-fix release.

It fixes [bug
13509](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=13509), which causes
a crash when the current culture is set to zh\_TW.

New in Mono 3.2.0
=================

Major Highlights
================

Runtime
-------

LLVM updated to version 3.2, this brings better optimizations for mono.

Garbage Collector
-----------------

Mono now defaults to the SGen Garbage Collector.

A lot of work went into making this the best performing and most stable
release of our collector.

As part of making it broadly usable, two problematic workloads were
addressed and make much faster.

One is the popular object workload, where a few pinned nursery objects
are very popular with old generation objects, causing a lot of
remembered sets to be created. To avoid that, popular objects are made
immortal until the next major collection.

The other is the massive thread stacks workload, where a lot of threads
with big stacks need to be conservatively scanned. This used to put a
lot of pressure on the pinning stage since it would produce very big pin
queues. To avoid that, we employ hash filtering on pin queues and that
dramatically reduce their average size and we pin major blocks instead
of individual objects.

In addition to that, we switched to lazy sweeping by default, which
reduces major collection pause times and improves aggregate throughput.

Three new experimental modes for the garbage collection are now
available.

### Low pause mode

Under the low pause mode, SGen will execute major collections
concurrently to your application and only briefly pause to finish it. To
enable it pass major=marksweep-conc in the MONO\_GC\_PARAM environment
variable.

### Low promotion nursery

The low promotion nursery employs aging to reduce temporal effects on
object promotion and reduce the pressure on the major heap. To enable it
pass minor=split in the MONO\_GC\_PARAM environment variable.

Mostly precise stack scanning
-----------------------------

Now it's possible to enable mostly precise stack scanning, that can
speed up collections by reducing the volume of conservative scanning
needed. This reduces pinning, leading to shorter minor collection pause
times and increased space usage of the nursery.

Mobile
------

Mono 3.2 Basic Class Libraries now can fully build Xamarin's mobile
profile.

### Size Reduction

Multiple features can now be disabled for the classlibs to reduce the
footprint on mobile devices. FullAOT targets now enjoy much better
fallbacks and much more linker friendly code.

Performance
-----------

The FullAOT compiler can now generate much faster code for icalls and
has support for generic valuetype sharing, ending issues with missing
methods at runtime once and for all.

Optimizations
-------------

Performance of primitive parsing was greatly enhanced.

LINQ is now much faster with arrays.

Large object cloning and boxing is up to two times faster.

Optimize Marshal.Read/Write methods to avoid a trip to unmanaged when
possible.

Other platforms
---------------

Google contributed ports of NaCl for ARM and Amd64. SGen now works on
FreeBSD.

Installing Mono 3.2
===================

**Binary Packages and Source Code Downloads:**

`Source code and pre-compiled packages for Linux, Solaris, `\
`MacOS X and Windows are available from our web site from `\
`the `[`Downloads`]({{site.url}}/Downloads "wikilink")` section.`

**Quick source code installation:**

`If we have no packages for your platform, installing from `\
`source code is very simple.   `

Compile libgdiplus to support System.Drawing:

<bash>

`   $ tar xjvf libgdiplus-3.0.tar.bz2`\
`   $ cd libgdiplus-3.0`\
`   $ ./configure`\
`   $ make`\
`   $ make install`

</bash>

Then compile Mono itself:

<bash>

`   $ tar xjvf mono-3.2.0.tar.bz2`\
`   $ cd mono-3.2.0`\
`   $ ./configure`\
`   $ make`\
`   $ make install`

</bash>
