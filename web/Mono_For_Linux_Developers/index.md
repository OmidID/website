Linux Binary Installation
-------------------------

On Linux, Mono is available in various forms: through the [Red
Carpet](ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/ximian/redcarpet2) installation
software, as installers, or as packages that you can install. To learn
which way is best for you, consult our [ Getting
Mono]({{site.url}}/Getting_Mono "wikilink") page.

Linux IDEs for Mono
===================

As you might expect, there are many development tools available to C\#
developers, ranging from bare-bones text editors to complex integrated
development environments.

MonoDevelop
-----------

[MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com) is a project to create an IDE for
.NET programming written in C\#, using the Gtk\# platform. It is
actively under development, and is useable, though a bit unstable.

Basic Text Editors
------------------

[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) and
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) are general purpose text editors, not IDEs
designed for use with .NET and C\#. However, you can use them to write
software in nearly any language. For Emacs, you will want to use the C\#
major mode available at [davh.dk](http://davh.dk/script/) or
[www.cybercom.net](http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs/) to
handle syntax coloring and proper indentation. Vim supports syntax
highlighting for C\#, but not much else.

Other recommended text editors include: [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org/).

Eclipse in C\# Mode
-------------------

The [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) project is better known for its Java
IDE, and is in fact written in Java. However, it is a full-featured
development environment which can be used with plugins for many other
languages, including C\#.

To use Eclipse with Mono, you will need to install a Java Runtime
Environment from
[IBM](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux130/?dwzone=java)
or [Sun](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-linux.html), and you will
also need one of the following plugins for editing with C\#:

-   [C\# Plugin from BlackSun](http://black-sun.sourceforge.net/).
-   [Emonic Plugin](http://emonic.sourceforge.net/).
-   [C\# Plugin from Improve
    Technologies.](http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/)

Once all three pieces are installed, consult the Eclipse C\# plugin
documentation for instructions on how to proceed.
