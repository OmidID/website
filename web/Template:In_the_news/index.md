### 17 Feb 2004: Mono 1.1.4 and 1.0.6 released.

As of this version, Mono 1.1.4 has received more testing and more
scrutiny that Mono 1.0.6, and we strongly recommend that people switch
to the 1.1.4 release.

We will continue to support 1.0.x for those who can not do a larger
change, but keep in mind that 1.1.4 at this point is stabler, has many
less bugs, faster, better tested and more complete than the 1.0.6
series.

There are significant changes: make sure you read the release notes as
there are many exiting features in monodoc, xsp, apache support, xml,
relaxng, the C\# compiler, the VM and more.

Detailed release notes:

-   [Release notes](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.6/) for Mono
    1.0.6, xsp, mod\_mono, monodoc
-   [Release notes](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4/) for Mono
    1.1.4
