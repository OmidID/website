The [MonoTouch]({{site.url}}/MonoTouch "wikilink") toolchain can be used with any
editor, XCode or it can be used with MonoDevelop. You will typically
pick the IDE that better suits your needs.

If you are building a new project from scratch, you will likely use
MonoDevelop to take advantage of our advanced C\# code-completion and
Mono integration. If you are integrating Mono and MonoTouch into an
existing application, you will likely keep your code in XCode and merge
the two worlds together using Mono's embedding APIs.

Additionally, if you are integrating MonoTouch into an existing build
system, you might want to read on [the command line tools
available](#{{site.url}}/Command_Line_Integration "wikilink").
