    same bug: Fix a threadpool bug that would hang the threadpool
    activity under no load.
-   Xamarin \#99: Fix in parsing assembly names.
-   Xamarin \#149: Regex.Compiler is a no-op, for WP7 compatibility on
    the MOBILE profiles

-   Workaround broken Android C library, to make SGen reliable
