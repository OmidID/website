The [Monologue](http://www.go-mono.com/monologue/) web site aggregates
the blogs of users, developers, and contributors to the Mono community.

Stack Overflow
--------------

Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A site where users can [ask
questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) about software
development, including Mono. Many Mono contributors and community
members actively answer [Stack Overflow questions tagged
mono](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mono), so make sure your
questions have the mono tag.

Forums / Mailing lists
----------------------

The primary discussion forum for Mono community members and Mono team
members at Novell are the [Mono mailing
lists]({{site.url}}/Mailing_Lists "wikilink").

If you prefer a forums interface, you can interact with other Mono users
and developers through the [Forums]({{site.url}}/Forums "wikilink") interface to our
mailing lists.

community, can be found online in the \#mono IRC channel on the Gimpnet
