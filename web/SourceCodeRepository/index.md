Git Repository
==============

The Mono source code is hosted on [GitHub](http://GitHub.com) using the
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) source code control system for all of its
source code. Although only active contributors get write access to the
modules on Git, third party developers and easily fork the code on
GitHub or download full copies of the repositories to their own systems.

Here we describe how one obtains commit access to the Mono Git
repository and the responsibilities that come with that access
privilege.

Also, you can see our list of important [branches]({{site.url}}/Branches "wikilink").

Browsing the Sources
--------------------

If all you need is to browse the sources, you can go to [Mono
Organization page on GitHub](http://github.com/mono).

Building Mono from source
-------------------------

Once you've obtained the source code for different modules of the Mono
project, you'll want to [ build Mono from
source]({{site.url}}/Compiling_Mono "wikilink")

Contributing Patches
====================

Now that Mono is hosted on GitHub, contributing patches has never been
easier. If you aren't yet familiar with GitHub, you may wish to read
GitHub's guide on [getting
started](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/).

Once you've gotten a GitHub account and gotten set up, you should read
GitHub's guide to [branching a
repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/). Once you feel that
your patch is finished and you've tested that everything still builds
and works as expected, you can then issue a [pull
request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) which alerts the
active maintainers that they should examine and review your patch,
merging it into the mainline source repository.

Policies
========

It is important that everyone follow these policies:

### Coding Guidelines

We have our own [ coding guidelines]({{site.url}}/Coding Guidelines "wikilink").

### Code License

If you are about to commit code to a module, the code that is being
committed should be released under the X11 license. Mono code licenses
themselves are basically: compilers, class libraries and managed code
tools: X11; runtime: LGPL.

If in doubt, check with the maintainers of the module, or send mail to
mono-devel-list@ximian.com.

### Changing Code

Even if you have write access to the official Mono Project GitHub
repositories, that doesn't mean you can change code at will in any
directory or module. Directories and Namespaces have a sort of
unofficial ownership. If you are not the owner of a piece of code and
you want to make changes/fixes to it, there are two cases.

-   The change is a typo fix or a one-liner build or trivial fix. In
    this case almost anyone can commit (always remembering to add the
    proper changelog entry to explain the change). We say "almost
    anyone", because changes to certain directories almost always should
    be reviewed first. Such as changes to core stuff: corlib/System,
    System.Collections, mini/, metadata/, System.IO.

-   The change is larger. In this case the patch **must** be sent to
    mono-devel-list for review by the owner of the code and by the other
    hackers. Always submit such patches to the list or bugzilla,
    although you may put the owner of the code in the CC header. Hackers
    come and go. Mailing a patch to only a personal address is a good
    way to get the patch forgotten and missed. Plus, getting the patches
    reviewed as well as reviewing them, is a good thing, so try to get
    used to it.

Note: If the patch is an addition of code and doesn't change any of the
existing code, the rules are slightly relaxed: there is more freedom in
committing such changes, if they don't interfere with the existing
codebase.

### Owning Code

Now, how do you get to be the owner of a chunk of code? The answer is
simple. You wrote the code, so you're the unofficial owner. There is
also another way. After sending a few patches for the code, the owner
(or the core developers of mono, if the owner somehow disappeared)
trusts you and tells you you're free to commit without getting his
review first.

You can most likely find ownership by reading ChangeLogs or by using
`git blame`. The entries are with emails, so feel free to ask them. If
you are still unsure, post your patch to the mailing list
(mono-devel-list).

If you are the owner of a piece of code, feel free to commit code, and
delegate the work to others.

But, if you're not the owner of the code, committing a rewrite without
getting a review first is frowned upon (especially when the rewrite
claimed to fix bugs, but not a single regression test has been added to
the suite).

### Pull-Request Rules

There are a few rules to follow before making a pull request on GitHub:

-   Always make sure to add meaningful commit logs

-   If you fix a bug, add a regression test for it in the [test
    suite]({{site.url}}/Test Suite "wikilink")

-   Don't commit unrelated changes together with a fix: do fine-grained
    commits

-   Always check what you're committing: make sure you're only
    committing what you need and make sure you don't change line endings
    and whitespace. Do a `git diff` of the files you're going to commit
    and check the changes.

-   Don't do reformatting commits, unless you're the original author of
    the code

-   When fixing bugs, don't follow the documentation blindly, it may
    well be wrong. Test the behavior on the MS runtime or ask on the
    list for discussion if unsure. Don't be afraid of having your
    changes reviewed.

-   Never remove copyright notices from the code

-   Never remove licensing info from code

-   Never commit code you didn't write yourself or code that doesn't
    have a suitable license

-   For documentation fixes, never copy paste documentation from Visual
    Studio class view or MSDN.

-   Never use a decompiler or disassembler to look at proprietary code.

-   Follow the [coding guidelines]({{site.url}}/Coding Guidelines "wikilink")

-   Keep an eye on performance considerations, especially for code in
    core classes, ask on the list for guidance

-   Do a regression test run and a bootstrapping build if making changes
    to core functionality before committing. Do not commit code that
    would break the compile, because that wastes everybody's time. Two
    things are important in this step: trying to build your sources and
    making sure that you add all the new files before you do a commit.

Also, remember to pat yourself on the back after the commit, smile and
think we're a step closer to a better free software world.

Branches

For details on existing branches, see [Branches]({{site.url}}/Branches "wikilink").

Keeping track of code changes
=============================

### Via Web/Email

It is now possible to subscribe to a special group to track changes to
the Mono SVN repository over the web using Google Groups:

-   [mono-svn-patches
    group](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/mono-svn-patches)

### Via Email

We provide an e-mail based mechanisms to keep track of changes to the
code base:

-   [mono-patches](http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-patches):
    This mailing list receives in patch form all the changes that are
    being made to the SVN. To subscribe, send an email message to
    mono-patches-request@ximian.com and in the body of the message put
    \`subscribe' or click on the link.

This will send you an email message every time a change is made to the
SVN repository, together with the information that the author of the
changes submitted.

### Cia.Navi.Cx

The CIA.Navi.Cx project tracks the changes [in their
page](http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/mono)
