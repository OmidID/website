Are you looking for

''' Warning: VSPrj2Make\# is unmaintained and only supports VS2003 style
solutions. If you wish to generate makefiles from VS2005 or VS2008
solutions, you should use the generation capability provided in
MonoDevelop.

Once you have Mono installed in your system, you will want to install
the VSPrj2Make\# package to complement your Visual Studio environment.
VSPrj2Make is available from [its project
page](http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfcontent/downloads.php/prj2make-sharp/Windows/).

A screencast on how to install it is available
[here](http://www.mfconsulting.com/product/prj2make-sharp/tutorial/installing-vsprj2make.html).

VSPrj2Make provides an add-in to Visual Studio that offers a number of
features:

-   Create Makefiles (both Microsoft's NMake and Unix Make).
-   Create distribution units (packages your source code for building
    elsewhere).
-   Test your code from Visual Studio with Mono (Winforms, Gtk\# and
    WebForms and WebServices).

This is available from the tools menu in Visual Studio:
