--------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2011-0992](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0992)

Improper cleanup when freeing unmanaged MonoThread instances could allow
the use, after being freed, of some member data if the managed instance
is resurrected. This could crash the plugin or allow information
disclosure.

Version affected:

-   Moonlight 2.x
-   Moonlight 3.x previews

Version fixed:

-   Moonlight 2.4.1
-   Moonlight 3.99 preview 3

Notes:

XSP/mod\_mono source code disclosure
------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2010-4225](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4225)

An unloading bug can, under some circumstances, let ASP.NET applications
misbehave and return the source code (.aspx) of the application or any
other file in the web application directory.

Version affected:

-   Mono / XSP / mod\_mono 2.8.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono / XSP / mod\_mono 2.8.2

Moonlight Generic Constraints Bypass Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2010-4254](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4254)

Some missing generic checks inside Mono can be exploited (e.g. mutate
strings, run arbitrary code) by untrusted web (silverlight/moonlight)
applications even if they are executed under a security manager
(coreclr) that sandbox them.

Version affected:

-   Moonlight 2.x
-   Moonlight 3.x previews

Version fixed:

-   Moonlight 2.3.0.1
-   Moonlight 3 preview 10 (2.99.0.10)

Notes:

-   Moonlight 1.x does not execute managed code (i.e. does not include
    Mono) so it is not affected by this vulnerability.
-   The bug (and fix) is in mono source code but can only be exploited
    (by untrusted applications) when used by Moonlight.

mono-debugger Insecure Use of LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
-----------------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2010-3369](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3369)

The mono debugger scripts (mdb and mdb-symbolreader) misuse the
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable (empty case) which could allow
loading shared libraries from the current directory.

Version affected:

-   mono-debugger 2.4.x

Version fixed:

-   mono-debugger 2.8.1

Mono Runtime Insecure Native Library Loading
--------------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2010-4159](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4159)

The Mono runtime can be tricked to load native libraries from the
current working directory.

Version affected:

-   Mono 1.x and 2.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono 2.8.1

Note: this does not affect loading managed assemblies, only native
libraries.

ASP.NET Padding Oracle
----------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2010-3332](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3332)

Mono ASP.NET implementation is vulnerable to the padding oracle attack,
i.e. it leaks some details when invalid padding is being decrypted.
However it is **not** possible to download the `web.config` file from
the web server (and retrieve the keys or other data from it). The actual
severity of attack depends on the web application.

Version affected:

-   Mono 1.x and 2.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono 2.8.1

ASP.NET View State Cross-Site Scripting
---------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2010-1459](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1459)

Version affected:

-   Mono 1.x and 2.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono 2.6.4

Notes:

-   Mono's ASP.NET EnableViewStateMac default was FALSE (like ASP.NET
    1.0) and configuration bugs made it impossible to set it to TRUE.

Mono System.Web Header Injection Attack
---------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2008-3906](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3906)

Version affected

-   Mono 1.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono 2.0

Mono ASP.NET Cross-Site Scripting
---------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2008-3422](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3422)

Version affected

-   Mono 1.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono 2.0

BigInteger unsafe code overflow
-------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2007-5197](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5197)

Version affected

-   Mono 1.x

Version fixed:

-   Mono 1.2.5.1

Notes:

-   beware unsafe code

XSP source code disclosure [Windows]
------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2007-5473](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5473)

Version affected

-   Mono 1.x running on Windows operating systems

Fixed in

-   Mono 1.2.5.2

Notes:

-   Mono's System.Web.dll assembly didn't consider, before version
    1.2.5.2, some Win32-specific behavior affecting filenames ending
    with spaces or dots. Win32 operating systems ignores the trailing
    characters, even if the file-system supports them, and can access
    the similarly named files without reporting any error. This caused
    XSP to return ASP.NET source code, instead of rendered content, when
    executed with Mono under Windows

XSP/mod\_mono source code disclosure
------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2006-6104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6104)

Version affected

-   Mono 1.1.13.x (and later 1.1.x versions)
-   Mono 1.2.x

Fixed in

-   Mono 1.2.2
-   Mono 1.1.13.8.2

Notes

-   The problem is exhibited in XSP and, in certain cases mod\_mono
    (when configured with **SetHandler**) but the fix is in the Mono
    class libraries. To avoid any compatibility issues you should update
    both Mono and XSP/mod\_mono to the same version.

Workaround

-   Use Apache/[Mod\_mono]({{site.url}}/Mod_mono "wikilink") configured with
    **AddHander**.

Local privilege escalation via System.Xml.Serialization
-------------------------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2006-5072](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5072)

Version affected

-   Mono 1.1.17 (and prior releases)

Fixed in

-   Mono 1.1.17.2
-   Mono 1.1.13.8.1

Workaround

-   Code generation for serialization can be turned off using **export
    MONO\_XMLSERIALIZER\_THS=no** prior to executing Mono applications

XSP/mod\_mono directory traversal
---------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2006-2658](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2658)

Versions affected

-   mod\_mono 1.1.14 (and prior releases)

Fixed in

-   XSP 1.1.15
-   XSP 1.1.13.7, 1.1.7.13
-   XSP 1.0.9.1, 1.0.6.1

Notes

-   Yes the affected/fixed products are confusing. The bug was in XSP
    but only exposed when using mod\_mono. You should update both
    packages to avoid compatibility issues.

Mono ASP.NET Unicode Conversion Cross-Site Scripting
----------------------------------------------------

CVE:
[CVE-2005-0509](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0509)

Versions affected

-   Mono 1.0.5 (and prior 1.0.x releases)
-   Mono 1.1.3 (and prior 1.1.x releases)

Fixed in

-   Mono 1.0.6
-   Mono 1.1.4

Notes

-   This vulnerability wasn't fixed in MS ASP.NET implementation and
    could potentially lead into a small interoperability problem.
