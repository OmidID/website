This page contains guides to installing and running various Micosoft
ASP.NET Starter Kit applications with Mono.

Personal Web Site Starter Kit
-----------------------------

Below are instructions on how to run the **Personal Web Site Starter
Kit** on Mono.

-   Download the kit from
    <http://asp.net/downloads/starterkits/default.aspx?tabid=62>
-   Make sure you have the installvst utility available on your system
    (it will be available with Mono starting from the 1.2.4 release, or
    current from current SVN)
-   Unpack the PWS zip file to some directory
-   Run the following command:

<bash>installvst PATH\_TO\_PWS\_DIRECTORY/ PersonalWebSite.vstemplate
PATH\_TO\_TARGET\_DIRECTORY </bash>

-   Go to the PATH\_TO\_TARGET\_DIRECTORY/PersonalWebSite/ directory,
    edit the web.config file you find there find the Personal and
    LocalSqlServer connection strings and replace their connectionString
    attributes with, respectively, the following values:

<bash>Data Source=XXX.YYY.VVV.ZZZ;Integrated
Security=False;Database=startkit\_personal;User
ID=sktest;Password=sktest Data Source=XXX.YYY.VVV.ZZZ;Integrated
Security=False;Database=aspnetdb;User ID=sktest;Password=sktest </bash>

Substitute the XXX.YYY.VVV.ZZZ strings with the IP number of your SQL
server

Having completed the above steps, you need to prepare your Microsoft SQL
server (either the full version or SQLExpress) for use with the starter
kit. Follow the instructions below:

-   Make sure your SQL server uses mixed SQL + Windows authentication,
    allow connections over TCP/IP (server port 1433)
-   Create an SQL user named 'sktest' with the password 'sktest'
-   Create an empty database named aspnetdb, then fill it with required
    schema using the aspnet\_regsql utility that comes with Microsoft
    .Net 2.0 SDK. This database can be shared among all the starter kits
    ported to Mono. Add the 'sktest' user to this database users and
    make it the database owner.
-   Create an empty database named startkit\_personal, then use
    personal-add.sql script found in the PWS zip archive to populate it
    with the necessary schema and data. Add the 'sktest' user to this
    database users and make it the database owner.

At this point you are ready to run the application. To do so, issue the
following command on your mono machine:

> `MONO_IOMAP=all xsp2 --root PATH_TO_TARGET_DIRECTORY/PersonalWebSite/`

and then point your browser to <http://localhost:8080/> (replace 8080
with the port number your xsp is configured for). If everything went
well, here's what you should see in your browser:

**The welcome screen**

**The welcome screen after logging in**

[640px|abc]({{site.url}}/image:Pws_logged_in_screen.png "wikilink")

One thing should be noted about the user registration with this starter
kit. The application is configured so that every new user is created in
the disabled state - that is, you will not be able to log in even though
the user has been created successfully.

To remedy that, you have two options:

1.  Edit the Register.aspx file and remove (or set to **false**) the
    DisableCreatedUser attribute to the \<asp:CreateUserWizard\> tag in
    that file.
2.  On your Windows machine launch the SQL Server Management
    application, connect to the aspnetdb database and issue the
    following query:

<sql>UPDATE dbo.aspnet\_Membership SET IsApproved=1 </sql>

It will approve all the users you have registered (if you want to do it
for individual users, you need to consult the dbo.aspnet\_Users table,
look up your user, note its ID and append **WHERE
UserId=YOUR\_USER\_ID** clause to the above query)
