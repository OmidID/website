**GtkGLArea** is an OpenGL context provider for GTK+. It can be used in
several ways:

-   using the **`GtkGLArea`** widget, a simple OpenGL rendering canvas
    similar in use to **`GtkDrawingArea`**.
-   using a **`GdkGLContext`** to add an OpenGL context to almost any
    existing drawable widget.
-   using a **`GdkGLPixmap`** for off-screen rendering to pixmap
    objects.

Development
-----------

**GtkGLArea** was originally developed in 1999 by J. LÃ¶f. Xavier Ordoquy
became maintainer of the package until 2003. In 2006, C.J. Adams-Collier
took over the role, joined by Sam Hocevar in 2007.

Development takes place in the GNOME Git repository:

-   Web interface:
    [<http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gtkglarea/>](http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gtkglarea/)
-   Git URL: `git://git.gnome.org/gtkglarea`

Roadmap
-------

Version 2.1 plans to provide OS X support.

The use of [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/introduction) and
[Glitz](http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/glitz) drawing surface is
being considered as an OS-agnostic alternative to the GLX, WGL, AGL mess
that has been used until now.
