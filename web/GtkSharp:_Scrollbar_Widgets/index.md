[Range](http:/monodoc/T:Gtk.Range) widgets are your standard,
run-of-the-mill scrollbars. These should be used only for scrolling some
other widget, such as a list, a text box, or a viewport (and it's
generally easier to use the scrolled window widget in most cases). For
other purposes, you should use scale widgets, as they are friendlier and
more featureful.

There are separate types for horizontal and vertical scrollbars. There
really isn't much to say about these. You create them with the following
functions:

<div class="csharp">
    <pre><code>
    HScrollbar hscrollbar1 = new HScrollbar( adjustment );
    VScrollbar vscrollbar1 = new VScrollbar( adjustment );
    </code></pre>

</div>
and that's about it. The adjustment argument can either be a pointer to
an existing Adjustment, or NULL, in which case one will be created for
you. Specifying `null` might actually be useful in this case, if you
wish to pass the newly-created adjustment to the constructor function of
some other widget which will configure it for you, such as a text
widget.
