<p>Although most of the concepts from the Microsoft.NET Framework can be applied to Mono, we do need to have a complete set of free documentation written specifically for Mono.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com/</a> wiki is designed to be a centralized repository for all mono-related documentation and information, to make it easy for users to find what they need.</p>
<p>The wiki is currently a pretty good mess, and we desperately need your help with cleaning up existing pages, as well as writing new ones.</p>
<h1 id="writing-new-pages">Writing New Pages</h1>
<ul>
<li>Think about something that you recently had a lot of trouble finding information about and create a page dedicated to it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you need an idea for something to write, check out <a href="http://localhost:4000/Special:Wantedpages" title="wikilink">Special:Wantedpages</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h1>
<p>Here are some suggestions of ways to help clean the wiki up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go through the <a href="http://localhost:4000/start" title="wikilink">documentation table of contents</a> and find new things to add to it.<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li>Go through <a href="http://localhost:4000/Special:Shortpages" title="wikilink">Special:Shortpages</a> and add more content.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Go through <a href="http://localhost:4000/Special:Lonelypages" title="wikilink">Special:Lonelypages</a>, figure out which page(s) should link back to this page, and add the link.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Go through the <a href="http://mono-project.com/Special:Uncategorizedpages">Uncategorizedpages</a> list and categorize the pages.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Go through the <a href="http://mono-project.com/Special:Longpages">Longpages</a> list and if it makes sense, split them up into seporate pages.<br /><br /></li>
<li>If you see a page that looks like a big mess, add &quot;<strong>{{NeedsCleanup}}</strong>&quot; to the top.<br />You can see every page that is marked as needing cleanup at <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Category:NeedsCleanup">NeedsCleanup</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li>If you see a page that looks incomplete, add &quot;<strong>{{Incomplete}}</strong>&quot; to the top.<br />You can see every page that is marked as incomplete at <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Category:Incomplete">Incomplete</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li>If you see a page that looks out of date, add &quot;<strong>{{Obsolete}}</strong>&quot; to the top.<br />You can see every page that is marked as obsolete at <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Category:Obsolete">Obsolete</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Go through the mailing list archives, and pay attention on IRC. If someone asked a question that was answered, but is not properly documented, create a new wiki page or add it to the <a href="http://localhost:4000/FAQ" title="wikilink">FAQ</a>.</li>
</ul>
