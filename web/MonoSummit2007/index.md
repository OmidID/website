Planning Meeting
----------------

The planning meeting on Monday and Tuesday is open to contributors to
the Mono project to discuss goals, roadmap, objectives and help plan and
prioritize the tasks for the Mono project.

This includes Mono, [Moonlight]({{site.url}}/Moonlight "wikilink") and
[Olive]({{site.url}}/Olive "wikilink") as well as discussing future developments.

Developer Meeting
-----------------

The Developer Meeting will be held from Wednesday to Friday, we will
open with a status report on the Mono project, some success stories from
this past year and we will host sessions on the current state of key
components of the projects.

This year we will be allocating more free face-to-face time for people
to talk to the developers by having explicit "Meet the Experts"
sessions, and dedicating the afternoons for un-conference sessions,
hacking and consulting.

The current agenda is available
[here](Mono_Summit_2007{{site.url}}/_Schedule "wikilink"), but it is still a work in
progress. Please submit any topic ideas to the
mono-list@lists.ximian.com mailing list. [(Mailing List
info)]({{site.url}}/Mailing_Lists "wikilink")
