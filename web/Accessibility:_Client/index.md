Getting Started With UIAutomationClient
=======================================

As part of the second phase, the Mono Accessibility team is implementing
full support for the UIAutomationClient API.

For Developers
--------------

You can read about the architecture at
<Accessibility:_Client_Implementation>, if you are interested in how we
are implementing this API.

You will need to install UIAutomation from uia2atk trunk.
