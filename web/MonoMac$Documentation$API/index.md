API
===

MonoMac exposes a C\#/CIL binding to the Cocoa API and also provides
access to the ECMA CIL APIs and various other .NET& APIs.

<strong>API Reference</strong>: The API reference is available at
[1](http://docs.go-mono.com); [MonoMac namespace
documentation](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root:/monomac-lib)

<strong>API Design</strong>: The API design for the CIL/Objective-C
binding is covered in the [API
Design](MonoMac/Documentation/{{site.url}}/API_Design "wikilink") document and it
describes how we bound the Objective-C and C APIs from Cocoa and exposed
those to the C\#/CIL world.
