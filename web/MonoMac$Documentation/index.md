Documentation
=============

If you are new to MonoMac, read our [Installation
Page](MonoMac#{{site.url}}/Obtaining_MonoMac "wikilink").

MonoMac API
-----------

The MonoMac API binds C and Objective-C APIs from Cocoa. The
documentation is avaialble at www.go-mono.com/docs</a>.

The API design for the CIL/Objective-C binding is covered in the
[MonoMac API](MonoMac/Documentation/{{site.url}}/API "wikilink") document.

Samples
-------

We have ported some [sample
applications](MonoMac/Documentation/{{site.url}}/Samples "wikilink") from
CocoaObjective-C to [MonoMac]({{site.url}}/MonoMac "wikilink"). The samples **require
MonoMac to be [installed](MonoMac#{{site.url}}/Obtaining_MonoMac "wikilink")**.

The MonoMac community has produced dozens of samples, visit the
up-to-date [github
repository](https://github.com/mono/monomac/tree/master/samples) for the
latest in samples.

Tutorials
---------

The [tutorials](MonoMac/{{site.url}}/Tutorials "wikilink") on this site will guide
you through the steps of getting your sample applications running from
the command line.
