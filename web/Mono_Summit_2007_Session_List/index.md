Opening Keynote
---------------

Presenter: **Miguel de Icaza**

In this presentation we will discuss the progress since last year and
present our roadmap for the next year as well as sharing some
interesting stories of Mono.

Miguel created the Gnome and Mono projects and currently is in charge of
Mono and Moonlight at Novell.

C Sharp 3.0 and LINQ
--------------------

Presenter: **Marek Safar**

C\# 3.0 introduces many new and powerful features which target developer
productivity, and reduce the amount of code necessary to achieve the
same work. This session will explore each new feature in the context of
existing conventions as well as the implications of LINQ. If you want to
start writing Mono enabled C\# 3.0 applications you should not miss this
session.

Marek is the main developer for Mono's C\# 3.0 compiler at Novell. Prior
to joining Novell he contributed extensively to the C\# compiler by
providing new features and extensive bug fixing.

Developing Applications with Monodevelop
----------------------------------------

Presenter: **Lluis Sanchez**

This session will show how to use the MonoDevelop IDE to develop
applications with Mono: creating GTK\# applications with the integrated
visual designer, using custom widget libraries, ASP.NET projects,
working with Visual Studio projects, working with Version Control
integration, generating tarballs and packages, internationalization,
integration with Makefiles, and other interesting features.

Lluis Sánchez leads the MonoDevelop project and has turned a
community-driven project into one of Mono's most important projects.
Prior to leading this effort he was in charge of Remoting and ASP.NET
WebServices in the Mono project.

Birds of a Feather Sessions
---------------------------

A Birds of a Feather session is an informal discussion between a group
with similar interests. If you have an idea for a BoF session you would
like to host or attend, please list it on the [Summit BoF Wiki
page](http://mono.wik.is/2007_Mono-Meeting/Birds_of_a_Feather_Sessions).
Time will be set aside on the first and last days of the Mono Summit for
BoFs. You may also schedule after hours BoF sessions.

Towards A Virtual Babel: Mono In Second Life
--------------------------------------------

Presenter: **Jim Purbrick**

Second Life is a large, on-line virtual world where avatars dance, fly,
shop, play, meet, work, fall in love... and program. About 256k
residents of Second Life have written 2.5 billion lines of code and run
30 million scripts 24/7 in a continuous 3D landscape twice the size of
Montreal. This giant, collaborative development environment is run on a
grid of over 12k CPUs that simulate the land of Second Life. Integrating
the Mono virtual machine in to this environment has presented a huge set
of challenges but also major advantages and paves the way towards a day
where the Second Life software speaks as many languages as its
residents.

Dr Jim Purbrick has both academic and industry experience in designing
and building virtual worlds. At Nottingham University he worked on the
MASSIVE-3 virtual environment system and Prix Ars Electronica-winning
mixed-reality games with IGDA award winners, Blast Theory. In industry
Jim designed online games at Codemasters, developed networking and load
balancing technology for Warhammer Online, and is currently working on
scripting and networking technology for Second Life while setting up
Linden Lab Brighton.

NUnit
-----

Presenter: **Charlie Poole, NUnit Project**

[NUnit]({{site.url}}/NUnit "wikilink") is an open source test framework for all
languages that run on Mono or .NET. It is one of the most widely used
test frameworks for .NET and seems to be the only framework with the
stated goal of supporting Mono on an equal footing with .NET. This
session will a mix of information about currently available features and
those things that are coming in the new NUnit 3.0 platform. Here are
some of the highlights I plan to cover...

For newbies (brief)

-   What unit-testing is about
-   Writing tests with NUnit

For those who already use NUnit

-   Cool stuff in the latest release
-   [NUnitHowTo]({{site.url}}/NUnitHowTo "wikilink") - You tell me what you want
    covered

For the intrepid

-   Writing Addins for NUnit
-   The next NUnit

Charlie Poole is the creator of NUnit, the unit testing framework used
by Mono and also wildly popular in the .NET world.

Mono on the Mac
---------------

Presenter: **Geoff Norton**

A session covering the most common use cases of mono on the mac,
including but not limited to discussion on the current state of
System.Windows.Forms, Cocoa\#, ObjC\# and other Macintosh technologies.

Geoff Norton is the author of Cocoa\#, ObjC\# and the native
Windows.Forms driver for the MacOS. Geoff joined Novell recently and has
been in charge of improving Mono's OSX support.

Greengrass
----------

Presenter: **Federico Di Gregorio**

Greengrass is just another RDF library but with a twist or two. First it
is entirely managed C\# code, developed entirely on Mono. Also, it has
the ability to serialize and deserialize RDF resources (OWL instances)
into CLR objects giving the programmer the ability to use high-level
object-oriented programming patterns instead of the classical low-level
triple access. This talk will explain Greengrass internals, how to map
RDF concepts to an object-oriented programming language and will show
how to use the library and the ggtool program to work with an OWL
ontology.

db4o
----

Presenter: **Rodrigo B. de Oliveira**

General introduction to [db4o](http://www.db4o.com) with a focus on the
latest time-saving features such as Native Queries and Transparent
Activation which rely to a great extent on Mono.Cecil.

programming language) and currently is employed at db4o.

Mono on Embedded Devices
------------------------

Presenter: **Everaldo Canuto**

Learn what you need to do to get Mono up and running on all sorts of
embedded devices.

Novell he was a contributor to the GNOME project, and in particular to
the F-Spot photo management application.

Gaia Ajax Widgets - The alternative to Ajax
-------------------------------------------

Presenter: **Thomas Hansen**

So many Ajax solutions exists today for .Net and Mono, Gaia takes a
relatively unique approach in that it doesn't require you to know
JavaScript. Hear from the founding father of Gaia how Gaia works and
what makes Gaia tick.

Meet The Experts
----------------

Meet the Experts is your opportunity to interact with the Mono team.
Ever wonder what steps you need to take to embed Mono in your
application? Have a great idea for an optimization in Moonlight? Wonder
why the debugger isn't working for your application? Now's your chance
to get your questions answered and make your suggestions heard. The Mono
team will be divided into groups like Runtime, Moonlight and Winforms
and you will be free to wander from group to group and ask them anything
you want.

openSUSE Build Service
----------------------

Presenter: **[Wade Berrier](http://wadeberrier.blogspot.com)**

Installing software that is not included in your distribution can be
daunting for new as well as seasoned users. The [openSUSE Build
Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service) aims to make software
easily available for the masses.

From a developer perspective, the Build Service allows you to build and
distribute packages for many Linux distributions (SUSE, Redhat, Debian,
etc...). The system simplifies and automates several tasks that are
normally associated with packaging.

Rough outline of discussion items:

-   Challenges on Linux with users installing software, and how the
    build service addresses this problem. "I have some killer software,
    but no one is using it because they can't install it!"
-   Example of installing software from the Build Service
-   As needed introduction to rpm based packaging
-   How the build service eases packaging, promotes good practices, and
    fosters cooperation
-   Getting started and a simple example
-   Q & A

Using Mono.Addins
-----------------

Presenter: **Lluis Sanchez**

This session will show how to use Mono.Addins to create extensible
applications. It will explain the basics concepts of the library, and
how to create a basic add-in and add-in host. We'll also discuss about
design decisions to make when creating extensible applications, and how
to get the most out of Mono.Addins.
