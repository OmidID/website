ASP.NET Components
==================

JayRock
-------

[JayRock](http://jayrock.berlios.de/) is a modest and an open source
(LGPL) implementation of JSON and JSON-RPC for the Microsoft .NET
Framework, including ASP.NET. What can you do with Jayrock? In a few
words, Jayrock allows clients, typically JavaScript in web pages, to be
able to call into server-side methods using JSON as the wire format and
JSON-RPC as the procedure invocation protocol. The methods can be called
synchronously or asynchronously.

Gaia Ajax Widgets
-----------------

[Gaia Ajax
Widgets](http://ajaxwidgets.com/more/about_gaia_ajax_framework/mono_support.aa)
was built to mimic 100% the logic of conventional ASP.NET and basically
this means that if you know ASP.NET you know how to use Gaia Ajax
Widgets! Gaia Ajax Web Widgets does not have ANY cryptic properties or
code model you need to learn before you can use Gaia effectively, almost
none of our controls uses any other properties than the ones that comes
with native ASP.NET so if you know your way around ASP.NET you know your
way around Gaia! This can be seen from the fact that you don't need to
use WebServices to e.g. populate our AutoCompleter and from the event
that retrieves the AutoComplete data you can do whatever you like,
including for instance making a DropDownList visible or showing a modal
window.

Gaia AjaxWidgets provides Mono support.

ExtJS Extender Controls
-----------------------

A .NET Binding for the [ExtJS Library](http://www.extjs.com/) that
provides a number of data-bound control: tabs, Grid Views and Tree
Panels.

==============

Emerge Toolkit
--------------

[Emerge Toolkit](http://www.emergetk.com/emergetk), The emerge toolkit
is a web application development framework. The server is written in
C\#, and runs on .NET and Mono.

From their site:

:   Our goal is to reduce the clutter when developing AJAX-style web
    applications. The experience of writing an emergetk application
    feels like writing a desktop application, with state preservation,
    widgets, events and handlers, and so forth. It accomplishes what
    ASP.NET does, but without using any viewstate.

:   We support - without enforcing - MVC style development. Since this
    is a well understood pattern, we will address each of the three
    components below.

MonoRail
--------

[MonoRail](http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/MonoRail) (former
Castle on Rails) is a MVC web framework inspired by Action Pack.

MonoRail differs from the standard WebForms way of development as it
enforces separation of concerns; controllers just handle application
flow, models represent the data, and the view is just concerned about
presentation logic. Consequently, you write less code and end up with a
more maintainable application.

Parallel Computing
==================

MPAPI
-----

[Message Passing API (MPAPI)](http://www.codeplex.com/MPAPI) is a
framework that enables programmers to easily write parallel as well as
distributed software systems without having to use standard thread
synchronization techniques like locks, monitors, semaphors, mutexes and
volatile memory.

It is written in C\# and runs on Microsoft .NET 2.0 or newer, as well as
Mono.NET 1.2.6.

-   Easy parallel programming through the use of message passing
    concurrency instead of the traditional shared state concurrency.
-   A few simple primitives to handle communication between - and
    control with - different threads.
-   Cluster computing made simple through the same primitives regardless
    of whether a thread runs locally or on a different machine. The
    framework simplifies the connection of computing nodes.
-   Cross-platform - the framework has been tested in a mixed
    environment with machines running Microsoft .NET 2.0, 3.0 and
    Mono.NET 1.2.6. The RemotingLite framework was written specifically
    to fascilitate the MPAPI frameworks need for service calls across
    networks, and was also specifically designed and written to run on
    Mono.NET.

A [paper describing
MPAPI](http://sector0.dk/public_files/Introduction%20to%20Message%20Passing%20and%20the%20MPAPI%20Framework.pdf)

done by incorporating CORBA/IIOP support into .NET, leveraging the
remoting framework.

Features:

-   Tight coupling between distributed objects in .NET, CORBA and J2EE;
    components on each platform can act in either client or server role.
-   Tranparency: existing servers can be used unmodified, without
    wrapping code or adapters.
-   Extensive coverage of CORBA/.NET type mappings.
-   Native integration in the .NET framework; IIOP.NET is directly based
    on the standard remoting infrastructure.

XML-RPC.NET
-----------

[XML-RPC.NET](http://www.xml-rpc.net/) is a library for implementing
XML-RPC Services and clients in the .NET environment, supporting
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 of the .NET runtime.

Features include:

-   Interface based definition of XML-RPC servers and clients
-   Code generation of type-safe client proxies
-   Support for .NET Remoting on both client and server
-   ASP.NET Web Services which support both XML-RPC and SOAP
-   Client support for asynchronous calls
-   Client support for various XML encodings and XML indentation styles
    (some other XML-RPC server implementations incorrectly only accept
    certain indentation styles)
-   Built-in support for XML-RPC Introspection API on server
-   Dynamic generation of documentation page at URL of XML-RPC end-point
-   Support for mapping XML-RPC method and struct member names to
    .NET-compatible names
-   Support for Unicode XML-RPC strings in both client and server
-   Support for optional struct members when mapping between .NET and
    XML-RPC types

The XML-RPC.NET library is CLS-compliant and so can be called from any
CLS-compliant language, the main examples being C\# and VB.NET.

System Programming
==================

Mono.Addins
-----------

[Mono.Addins]({{site.url}}/Introduction_to_Mono.Addins "wikilink") is a generic
framework for creating extensible applications, and for creating
libraries which extend those applications.

This framework is derived from the add-in engine used by MonoDevelop,
although it has been completely rewritten and improved in many ways to
make it more generic and easier to use. The MonoDevelop add-in engine
was an improvement over the SharpDevelop engine, which took many ideas
from the Eclipse add-in engine.

Mono.Addins has been designed to be useful for a wide range of
applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs,
to complex applications (such as MonoDevelop itself) which need support
for large add-in structures.

Google's Diff-Match-Patch
-------------------------

The [Google Diff Match and
Patch](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) libraries
offer robust algorithms to perform the operations required for
synchronizing plain text.

-   Diff:
    -   Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list
        of differences.
-   Match:
    -   Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of
        plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
-   Patch:
    -   Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to
        apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.

This library supports Mono and C\# and is also available in Java,
JavaScript, C++ and Python. Regardless of language, each library
features the same API and the same functionality. All versions also have
comprehensive test harnesses.

Database Abstraction
====================

NetDataObjects
--------------

[Net Data Objects](http://www.netdataobjects.de) is a development tool
for Mono and .NET, which maps object oriented code to relational
databases. This concept is called O/R Mapping (Object Relational
Mapping).

NDO is able to automatically enhance the code, written and compiled with
.NET and Mono The enhancement works completely transparent for the
developer.

-   Developers save a lot of error prone code for data access.
-   Persistent classes in NDO work together with the NDO framework
    without writing any special code in the classes.
-   Object data is stored and retrieved automatically into and out of
    the database.
-   NDO generates new and can integrate existing databases.
-   The NDO Query Language is much easier to use than SQL and provides
    nearly the same abilities.
-   NDO Queries are checked by the C\#- or Visual Basic compiler, while
    spelling mistakes in SQL queries might cause program interrupts.
-   Developers benefit from the object oriented analysis, design, and
    coding methodologies.
-   Thus your systems show a better maintainability and extensibility.
-   With NDO switching to another database is easy. Develop an
    application with SQL Server\* today and use it with Oracle\*
    tomorrow.

You can read about how they ported NDO to work on Mono on their ["NDO
runs under
Mono"](http://www.netdataobjects.com/Portal/NDORunsUnderMono/tabid/94/Default.aspx)
