Mono is positioned to be the leading platform for development of Gnome
applications on Linux and is an open-source alternative for Microsoft
Windows development. The following links should help you get started
with Mono:

Core Components
===============

The Mono platform consists of the C\# compiler, the just-in-time
runtime, and other associated components:

-   [C\# Compiler]({{site.url}}/CSharp Compiler "wikilink")
-   [Mono Runtime]({{site.url}}/Mono:Runtime "wikilink")
-   [Debugger]({{site.url}}/Debugger "wikilink"), [Debugger
    Tutorial]({{site.url}}/Guide:Debugger "wikilink") and
    [Debugging]({{site.url}}/Debugging "wikilink") techniques.

Mono supports several technologies for developing GUI desktop
applications. Gtk\# is a mature binding to the Gtk platform, which is
used primarily for Gnome in Linux but also works in Windows with a
native feel. System.Windows.Forms is in active development. CocoaSharp
is used for developing Mac OSX applications.

-   [WinForms]({{site.url}}/WinForms "wikilink")
-   [CocoaSharp]({{site.url}}/CocoaSharp "wikilink")

Web applications are an integral part of the Mono platform as well.
ASP.NET 1.0 applications can be run within the Apache web server using
mod\_mono or through a light-weight standalone C\# web server called
XSP. ASP.NET 2.0 support is in development. Infrastructure for web
services and database access through a number of providers is also
provided with Mono.

-   [Database Access]({{site.url}}/Database Access "wikilink")

Mono comprises many other technologies as well, including cryptography,
code access security, and internationalization.

-   [Security]({{site.url}}/FAQ: Security "wikilink") (SSL/TLS, authenticode, PKI,
    CAS)
-   [Internationalization (I18N)]({{site.url}}/Internationalization "wikilink")
-   [Other Libraries]({{site.url}}/Libraries "wikilink")

Mono offers various ways of tuning your application:

-   [HeapShot]({{site.url}}/HeapShot "wikilink") live memory profiler.
-   [HeapBuddy]({{site.url}}/HeapBuddy "wikilink") total memory profiler.
-   [Code Coverage]({{site.url}}/Code Coverage "wikilink") for evaluating your tests.
-   [Profile]({{site.url}}/Profile "wikilink") for more information on profiling.
