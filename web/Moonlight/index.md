Moonlight is an open source implementation of
[Silverlight](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/silverlight/bb187358.aspx),
primarily for Linux and other Unix/X11 based operating systems. The last
Moonlight release (Moonlight 4 Preview 1) provides support for most
features of Silverlight 3, as well as compatibility with Silverlight 4.
The Mono project does not provide binary downloads for Moonlight;
however, packages for most Linux distributions can be found online,
either in official distro package repositories, or provided by popular
third-party repositories.
