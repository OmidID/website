#### this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key XXXX

If you get this error when loading a NIB file it means that the value
XXXX was not found on your managed class. This means that you are
missing a declaration like this:

<div class="csharp">
    <pre><code>
    [Connect]
    TypeName XXXX { 
       get {
           return (TypeName) GetNativeField ("XXXX");
       }
       set {
           SetNativeField ("XXXX", value);
       }
    }
    </code></pre>

</div>
The above definition is automatically generated by MonoDevelop for any
XIB files that you add to MonoDevelop in the
`NAME_OF_YOUR_XIB_FILE.designer.xib.cs` file.

Additionally, the class that hosts this code must have the [Register]
attribute.

#### You are getting a ModelNotImplementedException

If you are getting this exception this means that you are calling
base.Method () on a class that overrides a Model. You do not need to
call the base method in a class for models (these are classes that are
flagged with the [Model] attribute).
