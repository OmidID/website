Title: ./Libgdiplus
layout: default
---

Libgdiplus is the Mono library that provide a GDI+ comptible API on
non-Windows operating systems. Our implementation uses
[Cairo](http://www.cairographics.org) to do most of the heavy lifting.

Mono's implementation of GDI+ lives in the [libgdiplus SVN
module](http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/libgdiplus/) and
includes it's own internal copy of Cairo (version 1.6.4) but will use a
newer system version when available (since Mono 2.4).

Plans
=====

Due to it's tight relation with System.Drawing new versions of
libgdiplus are released with (almost) every new version of Mono.

Text
----

The current custom text engine is limited. GDI+ offers many (little
used) options that are not, or incorrectly, supported by libgdiplus. The
plan is to use Pango to replace our custom engine - but no work is being
done on this task at the moment.

A *proof-of-concept* is already in SVN but is **unsupported** and less
complete than the current text engine. You can use **--with-pango** to
enable it. Note that this will work *only* if you are building
libgdiplus with the system cairo, i.e. if you're cairo library is newer
than version 1.6.4.

Other Tasks
-----------

Cairo doesn't provide 100% of the functionalities required to implement
GDI+ or System.Drawing. A few features were added directly in libgdiplus
(unmanaged) or System.Drawing (managed). However some features are still
missing.

-   add missing implementation for
    -   [path gradient
        brush](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=321034)
    -   [path widen](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=320856)
    -   [path warp](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=400775)
-   other missing stuff required for System.Drawing (fill bugs for them)
-   other missing stuff, e.g. parts of the GDI+ API isn't exposed in
    System.Drawing (fill bugs for them)

Contributions toward completing those tasks are welcome.
