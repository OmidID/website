I was the senior product manager for Mono at Novell from 2003 to 2005.

My blog used to be syndicated on Monologue but now it can be found
directly [here](http://www.frenchguys.com) including its [Mono specific
entries](http://www.frenchguys.com/wordpress/?cat=3&submit=view)

Recent writeups include:
