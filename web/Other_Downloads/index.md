Binaries for other platforms (unsupported)
==========================================

Solaris
-------

Blastwave.org Blastwave is a collection of binary packages of free
software that can be automatically installed to a Solaris computer
(sparc or x86) over the network. It will even install missing
dependencies.

-   Mono on Solaris SPARC and x86. Use pkg-get to install it. You may
    need to read the HOW-TO to setup pkg-get.

Nokia / Maemo
-------------

-   Mono on Maemo for the Nokia 770 and 800. For help with the
    installation, see [Mono for Nokia](http://mono-project.com/Maemo)
    -   [Mono 1.2.5 Runtime Single Click
        Install](http://go-mono.com/maemo/pool/bora/mono/mono.install)
    -   [Mono 1.2.3.1 Scratchbox developer
        kit](http://go-mono.com/maemo/scratchbox-devkit-mono-1.2.3.1-2-i386.tar.gz)

Snapshots
---------

[Daily test tarballs](http://www.go-mono.com/daily/) of the SVN
repository are made almost daily. These are not guaranteed to build, but
have undergone a minimum sanity check in that the snapshot of the SVN
repository from which they were generated was buildable on the test
machine. The time when they become available is not predictable, and
there are sometimes gaps of several days.

The [AnonSVN](http://mono-project.com/AnonSVN) mirrors are updated in
real time.

[Snapshot
RPMs](http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/snapshot/download-trunk/) built
from trunk get updated every hour. These contain most of the packages we
ship but very well may be broken.

[Daniel Nauck](mailto:dna@mono-project.de) maintains a Ubuntu VMware
image with the latest Mono from svn head. You can find it at
[mono-project.de](http://www.mono-project.de/mono-image/).\
