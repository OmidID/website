We have ported some sample applications from CocoaTouch/Objective-C to
[MonoTouch]({{site.url}}/MonoTouch "wikilink"), you can:

-   [Browse the Source Code on the
    web](http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monotouch/samples/)
-   Use [AnonSVN]({{site.url}}/AnonSVN "wikilink") to download a copy to your machine
    using SVN.
-   [Download a
    tarball.](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monotouch-samples-2009-09-11.tar.gz)

Most of the samples are built using the pure SDK and Unix makefiles.
This is done to illustrate the process used.

There is one MonoDevelop for iPhone setup called `monocatalog-md` which
is identical to `monocatalog`. The only difference is that this is a
pre-made MonoDevelop solution file.

The samples require [MonoTouch to be
installed]({{site.url}}/MonoTouch_Installation "wikilink").
