Title: ./Accessibility:_Team

A page to assist in getting new team members up to speed and to lay out
procedures of how the team works.

### VPN

For some things it's interesting to be connected to Novell VPN (for
instance, to access [some build
pages](http://build1.sled.lab.novell.com/uia/)). So go ahead and install
the package **NetworkManager-novellvpn-gnome** (which will pull others
like **NetworkManager-novellvpn**, **novell-nortelplugins** and
**novell-ipsec-tools**).

After that, you have to configure the VPN connection. Left-click on NM
notification icon (systray) -\> VPN Connections -\> Configure VPN... -\>
Add -\> Forward. Then you should see a combo box which contains the item
"NovellVPN Client". If you don't see it, you have to restart the OS or
NetworkManager for the new module that you just installed, to be loaded.

Then, after you select NovellVPN Client on the combo, click Forward
again. You need to fill some fields (leave the ones not mentioned as
is):

-   **Connection Name**: NovellVPN
-   **Gateway**: vpn.emea.novell.com *(or the corresponding to your
    area)*
-   **User Name**: *<your innerweb username>*
-   **Group Name**: novell

After that, to connect: Left-click on NM notification icon (systray) -\>
VPN Connections -\> NovellVPN. You will then be requested 2 passwords:
the normal one is your innerweb's password, and the second is a global
novell password, request it in the channel ;)

### Planet

There's really not an official planet for accessibility right now,
because:

-   [David Bolter's one](http://aplanet.atrc.utoronto.ca/) didn't have a
    proper top-level or 2nd level domain.
-   Recently new created
    [www.planet-a11y.net](http://www.planet-a11y.net/) hasn't collected
    all the bloggers from previous planet yet, and the admin roles have
    to be worked out.

In the meantime, we'll request to the
[LinuxFoundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org) the creation of
[planet.a11y.org](http://planet.a11y.org) as another useful redirection
for the latter.
