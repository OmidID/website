What Do You Want to Know?
-------------------------

Since there is so much to talk about, and so little time, I created this
page for you to list things you to know about [NUnit]({{site.url}}/NUnit "wikilink").
I'll try to cover as many of these as I can during
[http://www.mono-project.com/Mono\_Summit\_2007\_Session\_List\#NUnit my
talk](http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Summit_2007_Session_List#{{site.url}}/NUnit_my_talk "wikilink")
at the Mono Summit. If you don't have editor access, you can send your
questions to charlie AT nunit DOT com.

Questions
