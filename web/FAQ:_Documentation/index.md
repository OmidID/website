Getting Documentation
=====================

''' Where can I find Mono documentation? ''' Mono documentation can
either be viewed [on line](http://www.go-mono.com/docs/) or off line
using the [GTK\#](Monodoc#The_Gtk.23{{site.url}}/_Documentation_Browser "wikilink")
or [console
based](Monodoc#Mod_.28Command-Line_Documentation_Viewer.29{{site.url}}/ "wikilink")
documentation browsers.

''' Why do I read "Documentation for this section has not yet been
entered." everywhere? ''' The mono documentation is just like the rest
of mono very much based on the contribution of users. But unlike the
actual code, documentation is not often contributed, therefore lots of
the documentation is missing. A [Mono Documentation Improvement
Project]({{site.url}}/Mono Documentation Improvement Project "wikilink") has been
initiated to help getting more documentation.

''' Where is the documentation for System.X.Y namespace? ''' Some
assemblies which are currently shipped with mono are missing in the
documentation due to some limitations in the build process of monodoc.
We are trying to include them to and hopefully these assemblies can be
documented in future releases of monodoc and mono.

Writing Documentation
=====================

''' How can I document my own code? ''' A good article on how to create
documentation can be found under: [Generating
Documentation]({{site.url}}/Generating Documentation "wikilink")

''' How can I contribute to the Wiki? ''' If you have no Wiki account
but still want to contribute documentation to the wiki please send your
articles to the
[mono-docs-list](http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-docs-list).
Someone will then upload it to the Wiki.

''' How can I write documentation for the base class libraries? ''' At
the moment only by using the [GTK\# documentation
browser](Monodoc#The_Gtk.23{{site.url}}/_Documentation_Browser "wikilink"). [Monodoc
Editing]({{site.url}}/Monodoc Editing "wikilink") has a short tutorial on how to do
so.
